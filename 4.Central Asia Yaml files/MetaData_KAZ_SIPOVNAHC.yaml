        value: The poverty rate as defined by national poverty lines reflects the
          share of the population that fails to meet the standard a country thinks
          is necessarty to cover basic needs.
      - id: Generalcomments
        value: This series only includes estimates that to the best of our knowledge
          are reasonably comparable over time for a country. Due to differences in
          estimation methodologies and poverty lines, estimates should not be compared
          across countries.

        value: National poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population
          living below the national poverty line(s). National estimates are based
          on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys. For economies
          for which the data are from EU-SILC, the reported year is the income reference
          year, which is the year before the survey year.

      - id: Statisticalconceptandmethodology
        value: "Poverty headcount ratio among the population is measured based on\
          \ national (i.e. country-specific) poverty lines. A country may have a unique\
          \ national poverty line or separate poverty lines for rural and urban areas,\
          \ or for different geographic areas to reflect differences in the cost of\
          \ living or sometimes to reflect differences in diets and consumption baskets.\n\
          \nPoverty estimates at national poverty lines are computed from household\
          \ survey data collected from nationally representative samples of households.\
          \ These data must contain sufficiently detailed information to compute a\
          \ comprehensive estimate of total household income or consumption (including\
          \ consumption or income from own production), from which it is possible\
          \ to construct a correctly weighted distribution of per capita consumption\
          \ or income. \n\nNational poverty lines are the benchmark for estimating\
          \ poverty indicators that are consistent with the country's specific economic\
          \ and social circumstances. National poverty lines reflect local perceptions\
          \ of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor.\
          \ The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with\
          \ the average income of a country and thus does not provide a uniform measure\
          \ for comparing poverty rates across countries. While poverty rates at national\
          \ poverty lines should not be used for comparing poverty rates across countries,\
          \ they are appropriate for guiding and monitoring the results of country-specific\
          \ national poverty reduction strategies. \n\nAlmost all national poverty\
          \ lines in developing economies are anchored to the cost of a food bundle\
          \ - based on the prevailing national diet of the poor - that provides adequate\
          \ nutrition for good health and normal activity, plus an allowance for nonfood\
          \ spending. National poverty lines must be adjusted for inflation between\
          \ survey years to remain constant in real terms and thus allow for meaningful\
          \ comparisons of poverty over time. Because diets and consumption baskets\
          \ change over time, countries periodically recalculate the poverty line\
          \ based on new survey data. In such cases the new poverty lines should be\
          \ deflated to obtain comparable poverty estimates from earlier years. \n\
          \nThis series only includes estimates that to the best of our knowledge\
          \ are reasonably comparable over time for a country. For economies for which\
          \ the data are from EU-SILC, the reported year is the income reference year,\
          \ which is the year before the survey year. For all other economies, the\
          \ year reported is the year in which the underlying household survey data\
          \ were collected or, when the data collection period bridged two calendar\
          \ years, the year in which data collection started."
